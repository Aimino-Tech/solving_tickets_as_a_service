# n8n Workflows for STAS / OpenSymphony

This directory contains n8n workflow JSON exports for integrating external services.

## Workflows

### 1. Slack Alerts — OS Events → #syntaro-alerts

**File:** `workflows/slack-alerts.json`

Receives webhook events from OpenSymphony and posts formatted alerts to the `#syntaro-alerts` Slack channel.

**Events handled:**

| Event Type | Color | Description |
|------------|-------|-------------|
| `ticket_dispatched` | Blue (`#3498DB`) | A ticket has been assigned to an agent |
| `agent_completed` | Green (`#2ECC71`) | An agent finished processing a ticket |
| `quality_gate_failed` | Red (`#E74C3C`) | A quality gate check failed |
| Unknown | Gray | Fallback for unhandled event types |

**Setup:**

1. Open your n8n instance
2. Go to **Workflows** → **Import from File** → Select `workflows/slack-alerts.json`
3. Configure the **Slack** node:
   - Create a Slack app with `chat:write` scope
   - Install the app to the `#syntaro-alerts` channel
   - Set the OAuth token in n8n credentials
4. Note the webhook URL n8n provides (e.g., `https://<your-n8n>/webhook/os-event`)
5. Configure OpenSymphony to POST events to this URL:

   ```env
   N8N_SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://<your-n8n>/webhook/os-event
   ```

**Expected webhook payload:**

```json
{
  "event_type": "ticket_dispatched",
  "issue_title": "Fix login bug",
  "issue_url": "https://github.com/org/repo/issues/42",
  "repo": "org/repo",
  "agent": "opencode-agent"
}
```

### 2. Crisp AI Support Bot (AIM-3333)

**File:** `workflows/crisp-support-bot.json`
